# Diabetes Prediction
The objective of the project is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The same was presented in a workshop where i presented the same while being a member of the CompBio Cell @VIT

# Dataset Used
For the prediction of diabetes the dataset used can be found on [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

# Constraints 
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Project Pipeline
1. EDA
2. Modelling preperation
3. Creating the model
4. Generating accuracy of the model
5. Imputing missing values
6. Scaling the variables
7. Dropping all rows with wrong values
8. Combining all the pre-processing steps
